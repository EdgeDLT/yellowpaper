Green Paper: A Community-Driven Technical Specification for Neo Blockchain

## document format
The base document started as pure LaTeX, as usual in academic publications, however the syntax is not considered as friendly as Markdown. So, why not merge both? :)
In order to facilitate the contributions to the document, we decided to adopt pandoc format, which allows hybrid LaTeX + Markdown syntax.

### base structure
The structure of the document consists of four files:
- green_paper.md : main document in Mardown + LaTeX (this file is automatically generated by `merge_sections.sh`)
- metadata.yaml : document metadata (authors, abstract, ...)
- greenpaperstyle.pandoc : document style (LaTeX headings)
- template.tex : base LaTeX template (pandoc default LaTeX template with small changes)

Green Paper sections are separated on `sections/` folder (these are used as source to generate `green_paper.md` file).

## build instructions
Install pandoc and LaTeX base. On debian-based linux, you can simply run `make install`, and all dependencies will be installed.

After pandoc and LaTeX base are available, you can simply run `make`, which will generate the green paper pdf.

### building specific section
Any section can be build using command `make section` and passing `SECTION` parameter.
For example: `make section SECTION=08_dBFT` will build section 08.

## How to contribute
If you know Neo technology and want to contribute, feel free to directly submit a Pull Request with the desired changes.
Initially, the idea is to create a broad and complete initial version of the document, which will be polished in the future.

This repository is currently MIT Licensed, but will soon migrate to a corresponding Creative Commons license (since it's more about text than code).
